# Lab 1: Compute-to-Communication Ratio

**Compute-to-Communication Ratio (CCR)** is a key metric that quantifies the relationship between the amount of computation and the cost of communication among processing units.

$$
\text{CCR} = \frac{\text{Computation Time}}{\text{Communication Time}}
$$

A higher CCR indicates that more time is spent performing useful work relative to time spent communicating, which generally leads to better scalability and performance in parallel systems.

## Modeling Speedup Using CCR

The following Python code models speedup as a function of parameters $\gamma$ and $q$, where:
- $\gamma$ represents the **inverse of CCR**, i.e., $\gamma = \frac{1}{\text{CCR}}$.
- $q$ abstracts parallel overhead, such as communication steps or synchronization cost.
- $k$ is a constant representing the size of the problem such that $n = 2^k$.

The speedup function is defined as:

$$
S(\gamma, q, k) = \frac{\gamma(2^k - 1)}{2q + \gamma(2^{k-q} - 1 + q)}
$$

## Interpretation

- When $\gamma$ is small (i.e., **high CCR**), the denominator decreases, leading to higher speedup.
- When $\gamma$ is large (i.e., **low CCR**), communication overhead dominates, reducing speedup.

## Optimal Speedup

To find the optimal configuration of $\gamma$ and $q$ that maximizes speedup, the following relation is derived:

$$
q_{\text{optimal}} = \log_2 \left( \frac{\gamma \cdot \ln(2) \cdot n}{2 + \gamma} \right)
$$

This equation yields the values of $q$ that optimize the speedup for given values of $\gamma$.

## Visualization

The 3D surface plot generated by the code shows:
- The relationship between $\gamma$, $q$, and the resulting speedup $S(\gamma, q, k)$.
- The red curve highlights the path of **optimal speedup** across varying values of $\gamma$.

This visualization emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high compute-to-communication ratio and carefully choosing granularity parameters to achieve efficient parallel performance.
